# Leraning Objectives

* Understand what linting is the extent of its usages (which kind of file can be linted, and the impact of running it often)
* Understand the difference between unit tests and integration tests
* Use code coverage as a helper to write tests
* Understand that not only “classical” code is to be tested, but also a lot of the artifacts we can generate
* Understand how “component”-based testing for acceptance and end to end validation is to be used

# Prerequisites

* Same tools as previous module
* Golang in v1.15.*
* NPM v7+ with NodeJS v14.* (stable)
* Python 3 with pip module

# Lifecycle

* build: Compilethe source code of the application

* run: Run the application in background

* stop: Stop the application

* clean: Delte the files

* test: You want to test it to ensure that it behaves as expected. With the application started, you may want to use the command line curl

* unit-tests: Run unit tests in coverage

* integration-tests: Run integration test in coverage

* help: Print all target make
